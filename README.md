# America's Weather and Beekeeper's Business Analysis

## Background

Ivry-B is a startup that sells self-built beehive kits and is preparing for crowd-funding. In order to achieve their goals, they have set out to analyze the relationship between weather and beekeeper's businesses in the USA. Specifically, their objectives are:

1. Determine if the weather affects the market distribution of beekeeper's associations across the USA.
2. Examine each region's beekeeping organizations' proportions.
3. Define market size for each state to determine where to focus their marketing efforts.

## Data

We collected data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) to examine the relationship between America's weather and beekeeper's businesses. Additionally, we scraped beekeeper's organizations leads across the web (view source.txt).

## Goals and Results

Our analysis was conducted with the following goals in mind:

1. Identify if there is a correlation between weather and market distribution (beekeeper's associations) across the USA.
2. Inspect the proportions of beekeeping organizations for each region and identify any trends or patterns.
3. Define the market size for each state to help focus marketing efforts.

Our results are summarized below:

1. No significant correlation was found between weather and market distribution of beekeeper's associations across the USA.
2. Our analysis did not reveal any trends or patterns in the proportions of beekeeping organizations across different regions.
3. We identified the top states in each region that could be targeted for marketing efforts based on their market size.

For a more detailed explanation of our analysis and findings, please refer to the relevant notebooks or reports in the project repository.

## Future Work

This analysis can be extended in the following ways:

- Collecting more data from different sources to get a more comprehensive view of the beekeeping industry across the USA.
- Analyzing the impact of environmental factors other than weather on the beekeeping industry.
- Conducting a survey of beekeepers to get more insights into the beekeeping industry and its trends.
