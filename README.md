## Background
![Icon](C:/Users/iftah/Desktop/data analyst studies/project/Ivry B/icon.png)

Ivry-B, a startup that sells home-made, self-build kits of beehives, is preparing for crowd-funding and has set a few goals:

1. Find if the weather affects the market distribution of beekeeper's associations across the USA.
2. Inspect each region's beekeeping organizations' proportions.
3. Define market size for each state to find where to focus the marketing on.

## Data

We collected data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) to examine the relationship between America's weather and beekeeper's businesses. We also scraped beekeeper's organizations leads across the web (view source.txt).

## Goals and Results:

We conducted our analysis to achieve the following goals:

Identify if there is a correlation between weather and market distribution (beekeeper's associations) across the USA.
Inspect the proportions of beekeeping organizations for each region and identify any trends or patterns.
Define the market size for each state to help focus marketing efforts.
Our results are summarized as follows:
No significant correlation was found between weather and market distribution of beekeeper's associations across the USA.
Our analysis did not reveal any trends or patterns in the proportions of beekeeping organizations across different regions.
We identified the top states in each region that could be targeted for marketing efforts based on their market size.
For a more detailed explanation of our analysis and findings, please refer to the relevant notebooks or reports in the project repository.
## Future Work

This analysis can be extended in the following ways:

- Collecting more data from different sources to get a more comprehensive view of the beekeeping industry across the USA.
- Analyzing the impact of environmental factors other than weather on the beekeeping industry.
- Conducting a survey of beekeepers to get more insights into the beekeeping industry and its trends.
